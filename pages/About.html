I am a newly graduate student from Carleton University in Ottawa. Now I am looking for a junior software developer job in Toronto or Ottawa.</p>
<p>
My undergraduate study is about the Electrical Engineering, I changed the research field when applied for the Master study. Programming is like a magic attracting me. </p>
<p>
Fast learning skill is one of the advantages I have. I did not have much knowledge about the computer science when I was doing the graduate study in Carleton. However, I still got an average A when I finish the whole study, which is a pretty good mark for me. 
</p>
<p>
During my study at Carleton University, I did some projects, such as a UML online course selections system, MySQL bank and ATM server system, and a black box testing project to binary search tree project. 
</p>
<p>
After graduating from Carleton University, I know that I still lack much knowledge about the programming compared with the same newly graduates. So I followed an online course from Berkeley University about the Java and the data structure and algorithm. I did its homework, labs, and projects and uploaded the code to my Git. 
</p>
<p>
Then I began to learn about J2EE, some pattern, and framework, such as Hibernate, Spring, struts 2, JSP, servlet and MVC. And I did some small web application projects combining the knowledge I learn based on difference frameworks. Until now, I still go to the library every day with my passion for learning new things until I find a job in the future. 
</p>
<p>
Also, I followed the online course from “codecademy” and learned much basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, Jquery. I did all the projects on the “codeacademy”. Recently, I am learning Angular. 
</p>
<p>
Now I am looking for a junior software developer position in Toronto or Ottawa.  And I do not care much about the salary. All I need is an opportunity to enter your company to learn, to devote and to get some experience.
