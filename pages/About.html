I am a graduate student from Carleton University in Ottawa. My career ambition is becoming a full-stack developer in 5 years. Now I am looking for a junior software developer job in Toronto or Ottawa, no matter front-end or back-end.</p>
<p>
During my study at Carleton University, I got average A grade due to my hard work. Also I did some projects, which I think will be helpful to my future career. Among these projects, one is about a UML online course selections system, which taught me how to make a plan about designing a software. The other is a bank and ATM server system based on database. In this project, I learned to build a database using MySQL and how to do a teamwork. And another important one is about doing a black box testing on binary search tree project, which gives me great impact on how to do a Junit test and combination test. </p>
<p>
Fast learning skill is one of the most important ability I possess. After graduating from Carleton University, I know that I still need to learn more knowledge and build more project if I want to find the job I like. So I learned java systematically again. I followed an online course from Berkeley University about the Java and the data structure and algorithm. I did its homework, labs, and projects and uploaded the code to my GitHub.</p>
<p>
Then I began to get in touch with J2EE, some pattern, and framework, such as Hibernate, Spring, struts 2, JSP, servlet and MVC. And I did some small web application projects combining the knowledge I learn based on difference frameworks. Until now, I still go to the library every day with my passion for learning new things until I find a job in the future.
</p>
<p>
Also, I followed the online course from “codecademy” and learned much basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, Jquery. I did all the projects on the “codeacademy”. Recently, I am learning Angular. 
</p>
<p>
Now I am looking for a junior software developer position in Toronto or Ottawa.  And I do not care much about the salary. All I need is an opportunity to enter your company to learn, to devote and to get some experience.
